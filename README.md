# Michaels Home Page

So I wanted a simple homepage that would help my kid to start using the
keyboard more. So I made a 'hing.

## Starting Locally

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`

Runs a local server at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## Todos

- [ ] Add option to change case of puzzles (some keyboard layouts are upcase)
- [ ] Add more answers to the puzzle to limit duplicates per quiz
- [ ] Prevent duplicate Puzzles from appearing
